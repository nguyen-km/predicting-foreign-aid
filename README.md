## Introduction
Since the end of World War II, one of the primary goals of the global community has been international development. International development is “a benevolent flow of resources and expertise from ‘developed nations’ to ‘developing nations.’” (African Studies Center, Boston University). In this context, developed nations, or the global north, include wealthy countries such as the United States, France, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Developing nations, or the global south, constitute poorer countries in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. In simple terms, international development seeks to bridge the gap in wealth between the global north and the global south. According to the World Bank, the wealth disparity between countries has decreased since 1990. However, problems at the micro level continue to be severe. The UN found that the average income in North America is 16 times higher than the mean income in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite macro-level improvements over the past 25 years, international development is an ongoing issue. Developed countries are continually searching for methods to alleviate wealth disparity between nations.

In the post-war era, the global community prioritized two methods of international development: foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign aid. FDI is foreign investment in local economies by private actors. Corporate involvement in developing countries can stimulate economic growth and bring jobs to underemployed areas. While FDI allows businesses to participate in international development, contemporary research debates whether the net effect of FDI is positive or negative for developing countries. Some see globalization as a means to exploit developing countries while cutting costs and subverting high wages/labor laws in the global north. A much less controversial tool for international development is foreign aid. Money is sent from wealthy governments and individuals to developing countries and non-governmental/inter-governmental organizations for humanitarian and economic aid and development in the Global South. Ali and Isse (2006) found that GDP, trade, private credit, and government consumption were among the significant determinates of foreign aid allocation. This line of research can assist developing countries in prioritizing improvement in specific areas such as education and health care to stimulate foreign aid donations.

International development involves not only financial aid but also human and social development. Aid donors aim to empower individuals and governments in the global south to create sustainable and equitable societies. International development programs often include education, healthcare, infrastructure, social services, and economic aid. Although international development has brought significant benefits to many countries, it has faced criticism. Some argue modern international development practices promote Westernization and cultural imperialism and only reinforce global inequality rather than bolster equity. Others criticize the effectiveness and accountability of development programs and the unequal power dynamics between donor and recipient countries. The future of international development requires innovative and collaborative approaches that address the root causes of poverty and inequality while respecting local cultures and values. International development also requires addressing pressing issues such as climate change and environmental sustainability. Sustainable development practices need to be integrated into development programs to mitigate the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities. Additionally, international development should emphasize empowering women and promoting gender equality.

## Guiding Questions
- Can Machine Learning predict how donor countries allocate foreign aid?
- How do wealthy nations decide to allocate aid?
- What are the factors that most influence where aid is sent?
- How can developing countries use machine learning to stimulate aid donations?
- How can developed countries use machine learning to determine how to allocate aid?
- What sources can provide good data that can be used in machine learning for aid allocation?
- Which machine learning methods are the most useful for this line of research?
- How have economists used machine learning to research this field?
- Does political orientation significantly alter how countries donate aid?
- Do donors care about healthcare, education, and income inequality in aid receiving countries, or are political motivations what drive aid allocation?
