# Methods

- [Clustering](https://github.com/nguyen-km/ml-project/tree/main/clustering) (K-Means and Hierarchical)
- [Association Rule Learning](https://github.com/nguyen-km/ml-project/tree/main/association_rule_learning)
- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/nguyen-km/ml-project/tree/main/naive_bayes)
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/nguyen-km/ml-project/tree/main/decision_trees)
- Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- [Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/nguyen-km/ml-project/tree/main/neural_networks)

## Guiding Questions
- Can Machine Learning predict how donor countries allocate foreign aid?
- How do wealthy nations decide to allocate aid?
- What are the factors that most influence where aid is sent?
- How can developing countries use machine learning to stimulate aid donations?
- How can developed countries use machine learning to determine how to allocate aid?
- What sources can provide good data that can be used in machine learning for aid allocation?
- Which machine learning methods are the most useful for this line of research?
- How have economists used machine learning to research this field?
- Does political orientation significantly alter how countries donate aid?
- Do donors care about healthcare, education, and income inequality in aid receiving countries, or are political motivations what drive aid allocation?
